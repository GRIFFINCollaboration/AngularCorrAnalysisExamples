The items in this directory are intended as examples of how to code an angular correlation analysis using Methods 2 and 4 (as identified in the GRIFFIN AC NIM). They are minimal working examples that should run correctly out of the box *for the example data provided* in the ROOT file.

------------------------------------------------
To run:
   - Use GRSISort to open the ROOT file:
     > grsisort histograms.root
   - Execute the RunMethod2.C script:
     > .x RunMethod2.C
This will run a Method2, a2/a4 analysis. More ways to run are detailed in the PDF.

Detailed file information

AnalysisFunctions.C - a macro file with the functions necessary to fit a data AC with simulation using Method 2 or Method 4. This file (and specifically the SetupAC function) will need to be modified for the experimental setup used for the data.

histograms.root - a ROOT file of simulated Z-distributions and data angular correlations for 47Ca. The simulations were run for the 586-2013 keV cascade, and data is provided for the 586-2013 keV and 565-2013 keV cascades. (I assume that the Z-distributions will not change significantly when changing the energy from 586 keV to 565 keV.) Histograms and graphs of the Z-distributions are both included.

results2_example.txt - The output file that I get from running a mixing ratio analysis with Method 2. You can compare your output file to this to make sure that everything is running appropriately.

results4_example.txt - The output file that I get from running a mixing ratio analysis with Method 4. You can compare your output file to this to make sure that everything is running appropriately.

RunMethod2.C - an executable macro file with the necessary commands for loading the histograms into memory, loading the functions from a Method2 macro file, and executing the Method2 macro.

RunMethod4.C - an executable macro file with the necessary commands for making a TGraphAsymmErrors from the data histogram, loading the functions from a Method4 macro file, and executing the Method4 macro.
